## What?

If you're new to front-end development, you might want/need some one to look over your code and give you some pointers on what you've done and how it could be improved (or not). I think maybe I can help with that.

I'm happy to look at any front-end code (including pre-processed stuff). I only ask that you give me a bit of a description about what problem you're solving.

I promise to always be constructive and nice. I'm not gonna be horrible about your code. You should see some of the shit I've written.

## How?

Fork this repo and clone it to your computer > Create a branch > add a folder into the reviews folder with your username > add some front-end code to that folder > commit the code and push it up > create a new pull request. [See how to do this here](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork/)

## Why?

I dunno. Might help someone out. I would've found it useful when I was getting started.

## Who are you?

Hi. My name is Matt. I'm a front-end developer for an agency called @Bluegg. I've been doing this for a while but I'm not an expert, I am experienced though.

## I have more questions

Cool. Create an issue or @ me on Twitter (@matthewbeta)
